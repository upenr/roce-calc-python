# My Python scripts to calculate Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) of public companies using three different methods
1. Using data from Fprep - this works the best. Gives ROCE values of any companies supplied as input.

## Other Methods from Aug, 2019 (may not work anymore):
2. By scraping Yahoo Finance with LXML
3. By scraping Yahoo Finance with Beautiful Soup

## Buy or Hold Strategy
This Python script analyzes S&P 500 data from 1999 to early 2020 (supplied as a CSV file) and figures out if buying after a threshold (%) drop in the markets is better or if dollar cost averaging is better.
