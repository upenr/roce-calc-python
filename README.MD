1. By Mid-2020, Financial Modeling Prep curtailed free access to their APIs. Only 250 free requests per day. Therefore, this code may not work. To make it work, register and get a free API KEY, then append your URLs with the key. 
2. Using data from Financial Modeling Prep - this used to work best. Gives ROCE values of any companies supplied as input. However, Financial Modeling Prep now has an inbuilt ROCE calculator, rendering this code unnecessary.
